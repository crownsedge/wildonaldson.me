As the capstone project for my [Digital Media Programming & Management](http://www.newpaltz.edu/ugc/las/comm_media/major_dmprog-mgmt.html) degree at the [State University of New York at New Paltz](http://newpaltz.edu/), I created a business plan for Quiver, a dating app for smartphones aimed at LGBTQIAP+ people. The market is underserved, and they don't have an app that brings the same quality of experience as straight, cisgender people are used to.
