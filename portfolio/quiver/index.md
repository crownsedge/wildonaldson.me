As the capstone project for my [Digital Media Programming & Management] degree at the [State University of New York at New Paltz](http://newpaltz.edu/), I created a business plan for Quiver, a dating app for smartphones aimed at LGBTQIAP+ people. The market is underserved, and they don't have an app that brings the same quality of experience as straight, cisgendered people are used to.
