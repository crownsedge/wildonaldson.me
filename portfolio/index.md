I've got lots of things that I love to do. Take a look below at what I've been up to:

## [Radio](http://drifts.fm/)
My radio show and podcast [Drifts](http://drifts.fm/) spanned almost 70 episodes and helped me land an internship with [Sirius XM](http://siriusxm.com/) Satellite Radio.

## [Writing](/posts/)
Check out some featured writing from my school years and from my internship with Sirius XM.

## [Quiver](/portfolio/quiver/)
For the capstone project of my [Digital Media Programming & Management](http://www.newpaltz.edu/ugc/las/comm_media/major_dmprog-mgmt.html) degree, I created a business plan for [Quiver](/portfolio/quiver/), a dating app for LGBTQIAP+ people.

## Other things
Other things that fall outside those categories - some audio work, some personal writing. (Updating very soon)
