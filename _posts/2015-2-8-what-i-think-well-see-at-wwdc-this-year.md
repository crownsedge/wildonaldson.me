title: What I Think We'll See at WWDC this Year

I have no connection to Apple whatsoever, but I've had this very tantalizing vision of Apple's potential future and I'd like to share it with you. 

Apple will be undergoing a massive branding shift in that they will be completely removing the term "Mac" from their vocabulary without removing what really makes a Mac a Mac, so to say. Their two operating systems will become one code base, without significantly changing the laptop/desktop side of things, and without distinguishing an app that runs on a desktop or laptop from one that runs on a tablet or phone. The natural way to rebrand this is to use Apple as its own namesake, just shortened: the iMac will become the iApp, the MacBook Pro the AppBook Pro, the Mac Mini the App Mini, and so on. It's kind of cheesy, but also pretty clever. 

There are a lot of parallels to what Microsoft is doing with their new Windows 10 here, too. iOS 9 will be jumped over in favor of calling it iOS 10, just to have a little reminiscence of Mac OS X for one more year. Like Microsoft's Cortana, Siri will finally make the jump to the lap- and desktop. And a new Xcode feature, which I call Omni, will allow developers to have one single code base for their apps that will then compile to the computer, tablet and phone. 

A lot of this sounds like what Microsoft is doing, but it just makes sense for Apple's developers. If you can develop one app and run it everywhere, you don't have to worry about fixing bugs between multiple code bases or whatnot. Just have one app and have it run great everywhere.

I think we might also see Apple's television. It will probably be named Apple TV, and the existing Apple TV could have the word Box tacked onto the end of its name. I really want this television - one that has AirPlay integrated and can turn on smartly when I just want to play some music. I think it will be able to work with cable providers special services without actually needing a cable box - just one coaxial in on the back and it gets all the scrambled content.

Maybe all of this is just wishful thinking - but it's what I think we'll see. None of the products (except maybe that new AppBook Air 12" and the television) will actually be released within the span of time immediately after the keynote, but a rebrand here would simplify Apple's portfolio and the lives of developers.
