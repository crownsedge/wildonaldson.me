title: 'The internship: Sirius XM'
---

This semester, I’m doing an internship at Sirius XM’s offices in Washington, DC. 

Sirius XM began as two separate companies: Sirius Satellite Radio, founded in May of 1990 and headquartered in Manhattan, and XM Satellite Radio, founded in 1988 as the American Mobile Satellite Corporation and headquartered in Washington, DC. In July of 2008, the two companies merged into Sirius XM.

Sirius XM’s Chief Executive Officer is James Meyer. Gregory Maffei is the Chairman of the Board of Directors, which has 12 other directors, including Meyer. Scott Greenstein is both the company’s President and its Chief Content Officer.

Sirius XM is primarily owned by a corporation called Liberty Media, which owns 56% of Sirius XM, and also has minority interests in other companies such as Time Warner Cable, Barnes and Noble, Live Nation, and Viacom.

Sirius XM offers 24/7 commercial-free music, talk, and sports programming to its 26.3 million subscribers, making it one of the largest subscription media companies in the nation. It delivers its content via satellite in the car and in the home, and additionally to phones, computers and tablets over the internet. In addition to this, the company also offers traffic and weather services in supported cars. Its stock closed today at $3.61 and made $3.61 billion in revenue last year.

My time at Sirius XM will be spent in its Classical music department, and I will be working under David Srebnik, the Classical Music Program Director for Sirius XM. The majority of the work I will be doing is on the station Symphony Hall, Sirius XM channel 40. In my time here, I will be learning their software system, Dalet, that is used to create music programming for the company’s stations. In my one day of work so far, I have already done work that has a potential to be heard by Sirius XM’s subscriber base of over 26.3 million people.
