Working at Sirius XM felt like a chore at times. I wanted more than anything else to prove myself to my mentor and my coworkers. I would work 6 hour days, 5 days a week, with only a half hour break for lunch. In the end, the only thing that broke was myself. 

My mentor, [David Srebnik], was unlike any boss I had ever had before. He was stern, and had a lot of important lessons he wanted to teach me about working in an office like Sirius XM's. One of those was to not overwork myself. In the end, though, I did, and that culminated in my December 3rd hospitalization at MedStar Washington Hospital Center.
