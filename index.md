Focusing on innovative, music-based radio programming, I create the weekly radio show [Drifts](http://drifts.fm/) with a goal of entrancing listeners and furthering radio as a creative medium. I have spent time as an intern at the Washington, DC headquarters of Sirius XM, as well as behind the mixing desk at two college radio stations and numerous Internet radio stations.
