<p class="message">Hello there! If I sent you an early link to this website, welcome! Let me know your thoughts. If I didn't, you're not really supposed to be here - this website is still technically under construction. For now, visit my current public website, <a href="http://tazmily.com">tazmily.com</a>. Thanks!</p>

Focusing on innovative, music-based radio programming, I create and curate the bi-weekly electronic music radio show and podcast [Drifts](http://drifts.fm/), with a goal of entrancing listeners and furthering radio as a creative medium. I have spent time as an intern at the Washington, DC headquarters of [Sirius XM](http://www.siriusxm.com), as well as behind the mixing desk at two [college](http://whrwfm.org) [radio](http://wfnp.org) stations and numerous [Internet radio](http://rwd.fm) stations.
