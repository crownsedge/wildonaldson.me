Focusing on innovative, music-based radio programming, I create and curate the bi-weekly electronic music radio show and podcast [Drifts](http://drifts.fm/), with a goal of entrancing listeners and furthering radio as a creative medium. I have spent time as an intern at the Washington, DC headquarters of [Sirius XM](http://www.siriusxm.com), as well as behind the mixing desk at two [college](http://whrwfm.org) [radio](http://wfnp.org) stations and numerous [Internet radio](http://rwd.fm) stations.
