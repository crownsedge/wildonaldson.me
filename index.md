<p class="message">Hello there! This website is still under construction, so let me know your thoughts!</p>

Focusing on innovative, music-based radio programming, I create and curate the electronic music radio show and podcast [Drifts](http://drifts.fm/), with a goal of entrancing listeners and furthering radio as a creative medium. I have spent time as an intern at the Washington, DC headquarters of [Sirius XM](http://www.siriusxm.com), as well as behind the mixing desk at two [college](http://whrwfm.org) [radio](http://wfnp.org) stations and numerous [Internet radio](http://rwd.fm) stations.

Read more [about me](/about/), or take a look at [my portfolio](/portfolio/). If you're interested in some samples of my writing, why not stop by my [blog](/posts/)? Or, if you want, just jump straight to [the resume](/resume/).
