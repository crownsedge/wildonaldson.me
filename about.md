I'm a 24-year old graduate of the [Digital Media Programming and Management](http://www.newpaltz.edu/ugc/las/comm_media/major_dmprog-mgmt.html) program at the [State University of New York at New Paltz](http://newpaltz.edu/). In my free time, I like to [write](/posts/), listen to [music](http://last.fm/user/nukumi), and watch people [play video games](http://twitch.tv). I also used to make this really cool [radio show](http://drifts.fm/).

## Want to get in touch?
I can be reached in a lot of ways. Some of them are [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wonaldson), [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/wonaldson), and good old-fashioned [email](mailto:wil@wildonaldson.me). I'm also available by phone or Skype - just ask for my number using one of those methods.

## And now, for some questions.

### What do you know?

I know the ins and outs of this modern media world we all live in. I've spent time running [professional](https://twitter.com/driftsfm) social [media](https://facebook.com/driftsfm) accounts and maintaining accounts on media sites like [SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com/drifts) and YouTube. I know how to use modern content creation and editing suites – I became fluent in [Adobe Audition](http://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html) and [Adobe Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) over the course of my time creating my radio show and have worked in [Avid Media Composer](http://www.avid.com/en/media-composer) and [Final Cut Pro](http://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/) over the years for various video projects.

I know how to write, as well, with a sharp focus on clarity of meaning. A number of examples of my academic work are available to read [here](/posts/), and examples of personal work are available by request.

I also know how to effectively use various types of content management systems. For the web, I have experience with [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org), [Drupal](http://drupal.org), and [modX](http://modx.com), and this website is built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) (my new favorite). I also have experience managing content in multimedia-based systems – for my radio show, I use [iTunes](http://apple.com/itunes), and when I was an intern at Sirius XM, I learned how to use [Dalet](http://www.dalet.com).

Most importantly, though, I know how it feels to have to navigate this new digital world, and I thrive on being a part of it.

### What do you believe?

I believe in a polished product. My love for [Apple](http://apple.com/) products has made me love the idea of crafting something to perfection, and that's what I've strived to do with my [radio show](http://drifts.fm) and this website. Likewise, I believe in being well-understood - this website is written in very easy to read English, and for good reason.

I believe in the beauty of the world. I believe in the beauty of human emotion and in treating each other well. I believe in equality, no matter what the case. Every animal on this planet (yes, that includes us) needs to be well-cared for. People need music and people need technology. I love both and want to use them to help people.

I believe in honesty. Capital-H honesty. We all go through life just trying to survive, so the least I can do is be honest to other people. I believe in working well with others, and bringing professionalism into your personality.

I believe in openness. The entirety of this website is written using an open-source toolchain - more on that below.

### What do you want?

I want to change the world. At the very least, I want the things I work on to touch people. If you can affect enough people, if you can change people's lives just a small amount, in your own way, you *have* changed the world, even if just a little bit.

### What do you like?

I like collecting music and headphones. I have a couple really nice pairs of headphones that I use for various purposes, and they're pretty great. I like to write, as well, especially when it's about something I enjoy. (Not sure what that says about me considering this entire website is about myself.) I like to sit back and think about the future.

### Is there anything I should know?

I identify as [non-binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genderqueer), and am a strident supporter of queer and transgender rights. If your workplace is not inclusive or supportive of marginalized people, I will likely not be a good fit. Please use either "they" or "he" pronouns.

### Tell me about this website.
That's not a question.

This website is coded with [Atom](http://www.atom.io), created with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and themed with [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com), and it's all running on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) for free thanks to [Namecheap](http://nc.me).
