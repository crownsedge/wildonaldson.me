I'm a 24-year old [Digital Media Programming and Management](http://www.newpaltz.edu/ugc/las/comm_media/major_dmprog-mgmt.html) student finishing up his last year at the [State University of New York at New Paltz](http://newpaltz.edu/). In my free time, I like to [write](/posts/), listen to [music](http://last.fm/user/nukumi), and watch people [play video games](http://twitch.tv). I also used to make this really cool [radio show](http://drifts.fm/). If you're curious, you can read about the [classes I'm taking](/school/) this semester.

## Want to get in touch?
I can be reached in a lot of ways. Some of them are [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wonaldson), [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/wonaldson), and good old-fashioned [email](mailto:wil@wildonaldson.me). I'm also available by phone or Skype - just ask for my number using one of those methods.

## And now, for some questions.

### What do you know?
(Rewriting)

(cms) how to enter metadata into a content management system very effectively. For my radio show, I use [iTunes](http://apple.com/itunes), and when I was an intern at Sirius XM, I learned how to use [Dalet](http://www.dalet.com).

### What do you believe?

I believe in a polished product. My love for [Apple](http://apple.com/) products has made me love the idea of crafting something to perfection, and that's what I've strived to do with my [radio show](http://drifts.fm) and this website. Likewise, I believe in being well-understood - this website is written in very easy to read English, and for good reason.

I believe in the beauty of the world. I believe in the beauty of human emotion and treating each other well. I believe in equality, no matter what the case. Every animal on this planet (yes, that includes us) needs to be well-cared for. And so I want the world to change, and by living my life and trying to make myself the best person I can be, I'm doing my part in furthering the survival of the human race. People need music and people need technology. I love both and want to help people with them.

I believe in honesty. Capital-H honesty. We all go through life just trying to survive, so the least I can do is be honest to other people. I believe in working well with others, and bringing professionalism into your personality.

I believe in openness. The entirety of this website is written using an open-source toolchain - more about that below.

### What do you want?

I want to change the world. At the very least, I want the things I work on to touch people. If you can affect enough people, if you can change people's lives just a small amount, in your own way, you *have* changed the world, even if just a little bit.

### What do you like?

I like collecting music and headphones. I have a couple really nice pairs of headphones that I use for various purposes, and they're pretty great. I like to write, I guess, especially when it's about something I enjoy. (Not sure what that says about me considering this entire website is about myself.) I like to sit back and think about the future.

### Tell me about this website.
That's not a question.

This website is coded with [Atom](http://www.atom.io), created with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and themed with [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com), and it's all running on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) for free thanks to [Namecheap](http://nc.me).
