## Summary

For five years, I created innovative, music-oriented radio programming with an aim to entrance listeners and further the progress of radio as a creative medium. With my radio show, [Drifts](#drifts), I have worked with numerous musicians to promote their works and spread the music I love to a fanbase of hundreds of listeners. At [Sirius XM](#sirius-xm), I spent time working as an intern in their classical music department, and became familiar with their content management system Dalet.

## Education

I have a Bachelor of Arts in [Digital Media Programming & Management](http://www.newpaltz.edu/ugc/las/comm_media/major_dmprog-mgmt.html) from the [State University of New York at New Paltz](http://newpaltz.edu). I graduated in May of 2016 with a GPA of {{ page.gpa }}.

In the past, I also spent time at [Binghamton University](http://binghamton.edu), working towards a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from August 2009 to April of 2011.

## Experience

### Sirius XM

From September to December of 2014, I worked out of [Sirius XM](http://siriusxm.com/)'s Washington D.C. offices as a Classical Music Intern. I assembled and mixed daily shows for air, ingested new classical music into their digital music library, assisted in the maintenance and upkeep of said library, and assisted the on-air talent with show preparation. My work was heard daily on [Symphony Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_Hall_(Sirius_XM)), channel 76. In addition, I briefly contributed writing talent to the *This Day in Classical Music* segment on [Sirius XM Pops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius_XM_Pops), channel 75.

### Drifts

From September of 2010 to November of 2015, I produced and presented [Drifts](http://drifts.fm/), a new music radio show focusing on the stranger, more futuristic sides of the emerging Electronic music underground. Over the course of nearly 70 episodes, I spent time researching and finding new music for airplay, interviewing guests for air, managing a social media brand including Facebook and Twitter, and kept an updated website, all with consistent visual branding. The show is currently on hiatus.

### WFNP The Edge

From February to November of 2013, I aired Drifts from [WFNP](http://wfnp.org/) The Edge, the campus station of SUNY New Paltz. In addition to airing Drifts, I worked with Production department to import promotional CDs into our computer automation system and create station identification audio.

### WHRW-FM

From January 2010 to April of 2011, I was a member of [WHRW-FM](http://whrwfm.org/), the campus station of Binghamton University. In addition to airing Drifts, I also trained potential DJs in operation of station equipment, worked with the Production department to create station imaging, and worked with the Music department to audition CDs to recommend for addition to our library.

### Indievidual Radio

From 2009 to 2011, I owned and operated a small Internet-based radio station for a small community of music lovers. I set up and maintained an [Icecast](http://icecast.org/) server and [MPD](http;//musicpd.org/) automation, and managed the stationâ€™s DJs, including the recruiting and training of new DJs, assigning time slots for each.

## Skills

I have excellent [writing skills](/posts/) and am very knowledgeable with [Adobe Audition](http://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html) and [Audacity](http://audacityteam.org/). I primarily use Apple [Pages](http://www.apple.com/mac/pages/) and [Keynote](http://www.apple.com/mac/keynote/) for my word processing and presentation needs. HTML5 and CSS3 helped build this website, and I can get my way around Photoshop, Microsoft Word, and an FTP client (I use [Transmit](http://panic.com/transmit)). I am also proficient with [Github](http://github.com/) and the UNIX shell.
