## Summary

For six years, I created innovative, music-oriented radio programming with an aim to entrance listeners and further the progress of radio as a creative medium. With my radio show, Drifts, I have worked with numerous musicians to promote their works and spread the music I love to a fanbase of hundreds of listeners. At Sirius XM, I spent time working as an intern in their classical music department, and am familiar with their content management system Dalet.

I'm expecting to graduate in the Spring of 2016, and have a current GPA of {{ page.gpa }}.

I spent time researching and finding new music for airplay, interviewing guests for air, managing a social media brand including Facebook and Twitter, and kept an updated website, all with consistent visual branding.

In addition to airing Drifts, I also trained potential DJs in operation of station equipment, worked with the Production department to create station imaging, and worked with the Music department to audition CDs to recommend for addition to our library.

### Indievidual Radio

From 2009 to 2011, I owned and operated a small Internet-based radio station for a small community of music lovers. I set up and maintained an Icecast server and MPD automation, and managed the stationâ€™s DJs, including the recruiting and training of new DJs, assigning time slots for each.

## Skills
