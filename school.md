I'm currently a Digital Media Programming and Management major at the State University of New York at New Paltz, in my last few weeks of classes. I'm taking four classes this semester:

Visual thinking, critical analysis, character, plot, structure, dialogue, and rewriting to create treatments and scripts.

## DMJ 444: Digital Media Convergence

## DMJ 321: Milestones in Documentary
*W, 12:30pm - 3:20pm.* A critical and aesthetic reading of key documentaries, and their role of inquiry and expression.
