I'm currently a Digital Media Programming and Management major at the State University of New York at New Paltz. I'm taking this semester off, but here's what I'm learning in the meantime.

- Ruby and Jekyll
-- I'm working on using Jekyll to build this website as well as a new one for my radio show, [Drifts](http://drifts.fm/).
- Swift
-- I'm working on learning Swift to create a great iOS app for Drifts.
